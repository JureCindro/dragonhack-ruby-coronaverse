Unfortunately your co-worker has fallen ill (not related to SARS-COV-2 disease ðŸ˜…), and now you have to finish his tasks. Fortunately, he already implemented the tests and documented the code, the only part that remains is the actual implementation itself.

Your job is to implement the missing code in `app/results/repository.rb` in a way that the test suite (`spec/results/repository_spec.rb`) passes without modifications.
